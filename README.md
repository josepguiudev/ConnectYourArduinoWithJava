In this project we will see how to connect our arduino board to a mini program with java, where there will be a communication between them.

- 1: Download the JSerialComm-2-11-0.jar and deploy it in the libraries folder.
- 2: You can get this jar at https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm or on other websites, for example Maven Central
- 3: This code is not only software it also has a hardware part, you can see it in a folder called assets
